# 42_Cpp_Module_01

The goal of the **C++ modules 00 to 08** is to introduce the student to Object-Oriented Programming and the C++ programming language in general.
Because of the complexity of the language, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

**C++ module 01** introduces the learner to fundamental concepts like memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statement.

## Description

ex00:
Implement a Zombie class and write a short C++ program, that uses two functions to create new zombies. One returning a zombie instance, and one that doesn't return anything. Determine in what case it’s better to allocate the zombies on the stack or heap.  
(first intro to 'new' and 'delete')

ex01:
Write a program that creates a "horde of Zombies", checks if the Zombie instances function well, and deletes them.  
(first intro to the difference between 'delete' and 'delete[]')

ex02:
Write a program that manipulates a string via pointers and references.  
(first intro to the concept of 'references')

ex03:
Implement a weapons class, and a human class, that may use this weapon. Create a human who is always armed and one, that is NOT necessarily always armed.  
(understand when to use 'references' and when to use 'pointers')

ex04:
Create a program that will open a file and copies its content into a new file, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.  
(using C++ file manipulation for the first time)

ex05:
Implement a class, that displays debug/info/warning/error messages dependent on the level handed over by the main().  
(understanding the use of 'pointers to member functions')

ex06:
Dependent on the level of the error messages from ex05, Create a program that takes as parameter one of the four levels. It will display all messages from this level and above.  
(first intro to the 'switch' statement)

## Learnings

A great refresher for the next aspects of the language, I learned in my C++ course 2021, and the difference to good old C.
